The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.`,

      `There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.`,

      `To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Mental Health Solutions Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 123 Main Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.`,

      `We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.`,

Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to any person or entity, without your consent or notice. You may not assign or transfer your rights and obligations under these Terms to any person or entity, without our prior written consent. These Terms do not create any partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us or the Providers.
